1.0.1.2
Fixed GetQueryResultsDataTableToCsvFile. Was throwing a data type error because fields not passed in correct order.
Fixed GetQueryResultsDataTableToJsonFile. Was returning blank data always. Wasn't returning final JSON string.

1.0.2
Added ExecuteSqlQueryToList function to query data and return as a generic list with optional column names in first element.

1.0.3 - 6/8/2018
-Added SetCData option to set XMLSERVICE *cdata control option. Default is *cdata which means cdata enabled.
If cdata in on, returned query fields will get wrapped in the CDATA wrapper so ampersand (&) and 
other special characters don't cause XML parsing errors on the return data. XML parsing errors mean 
that no data gets returned into a DataSet or DataTable when a query completes successfully, but the 
XML data does not parse correctly.

=Add optional enableCData as last parameter to the SetUserInfoExt function. Default=*cdata(on)
Making the parm optional should keep it compatible. Since we can't tell when people will query
data with special characters it makes sense to default to *cdata. The option can always be
toggled by calling SetCdataOption(True) to set *cdata(on) or SetCDataOption(False) to set *cdata(off)
for the CData option.

Note: The YIPS docs say that setting should be *cdata(on) or *cdata(off) but both of these choices
seemed to result in cdata being on so we just use the *cdata keyword which seems to work fine.

-Changed ExecuteSqlNonQuery to look for 2 potential valid return codes. When Cdata is enabled, the 
XMLSERVICE service program returns the success statement with more spaces than when Cdata is off. Nice :-)
Original return check: <execute stmt='stmt1'>\r\n<success>+++ success stmt1</success>\r\n</execute>"
New check with Cdata enabled: "+++ success stmt1". 
We now check for both returns which should cover all non query return scenarios from XMLSERVICE.
Theoretically we could remove the original one, but now we just do a double check.
This should prevent any false completion errors from the ExecuteSqlNonQuery function when they 
actually succeeded.

-If *cdata is enabled, the following functions now wrap SQL statements with cdata wrapper.
ExecuteSqlQuery and ExecuteSQLNonQuery. All other functions ultimately map to these.
