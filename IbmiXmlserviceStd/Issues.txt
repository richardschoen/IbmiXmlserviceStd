1.0.1.2
Fixed GetQueryResultsDataTableToCsvFile. Was throwing a data type error because fields not passed in correct order.
Fixed GetQueryResultsDataTableToJsonFile. Was returning blank data always. Wasn't returning final JSON string.

1.0.2
Added ExecuteSqlQueryToList function to query data and return as a generic list with optional column names in first element.
